# HR-System
This is an HR-System which can be used to keep the employee details and employee categories in an organisation. Keeping in mind about my college staff mamnagemant system I made it. 

## Login Credentials

Login can only be done by `User` i.e. the backend handler who has been given access.

It needs `username` and `Password` for login.
